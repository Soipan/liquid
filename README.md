# liquid

This is a project i worked on with a friend of mine called Kim. We created a website on a spa, salon and barber shop under one business.

High graphic images are used to give the website a feel of what the business is about . The languages and frameworks used are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap etc.

It is heavy on front end development.
